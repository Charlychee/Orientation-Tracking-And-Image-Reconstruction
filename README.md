# Orientation Tracking And Image Reconstruction

# Overview
This project utilizes IMU linear acceleration and rotational velocity to estimate the rotation of a rotating body with a static position through constrained optimization. Then combines the estimated rotation with camera image data to create a panorama of the environment.

# Implementation
This was implemented in Python using NumPy. The code has been redacted, if you wish to see it, you may contact me at charles.lychee@gmail.com

# Report
